        <p>Since I need to fill this page with stuff, I'll just copy and paste Dave Brubeck's biography.</p>
        <img src="resources/images/daveBrubeck.jpg" alt="Dave Brubeck image" width="500" height="400">
        <p>Dave Brubeck (born December 6, 1920, Concord, California, U.S.—died December 5, 2012, Norwalk, Connecticut)
            was a popular American jazz pianist who brought elements of classical music into jazz and whose style
            epitomized that of the “West Coast movement.”
        </p>
        <p>Brubeck was taught piano by his mother from the age of four—and for a period of time he deceived her by
            memorizing songs rather than learning to read music. He worked as a pianist with local jazz groups from 1933
            and studied music at the College of the Pacific (1938–42) in Stockton, California, where he formed and led a
            12-piece orchestra. During World War II, Brubeck conducted a service band in the army of Gen. George S.
            Patton. After the war, he studied composition at Mills College in Oakland, California, under the French
            composer Darius Milhaud. During this period, Brubeck also studied with Arnold Schoenberg, the inventor of
            the 12-tone system of composition. He formed the Dave Brubeck Octet in 1946, employing fellow classmates as
            band members. The group made several recordings (released in 1951) that reflected Brubeck’s studies in
            polyrhythms and polytonality (respectively, two time signatures or two keys played simultaneously). The
            octet recordings sound ahead of their time even by contemporary standards, and the highly experimental group
            disbanded after their radicalism failed to find an audience. Brubeck next led a trio that proved popular in
            the San Francisco area, but he was forced to disband it in 1951 after he was incapacitated for many months
            by a back injury.
        </p>
        <p>In late 1951 Brubeck reformed the trio, which soon became a quartet with the addition of alto saxophonist
            Paul Desmond. Within several months they attained a measure of national fame, largely by word of mouth among
            West Coast critics who championed the group’s innovations. Also during this time, Brubeck became one of the
            first jazz musicians to regularly tour and conduct seminars at college campuses; several albums recorded at
            college concerts—such as Jazz at Oberlin (1953), Jazz at the College of the Pacific (1953), Jazz Goes to
            College (1954), and Jazz Goes to Junior College (1957)—are among Brubeck’s most highly regarded. For much of
            the decade, Brubeck and Desmond remained the only constants in the group; permanent members Joe Morello
            (drums) and Eugene Wright (bass) joined in 1956 and ’58, respectively.
